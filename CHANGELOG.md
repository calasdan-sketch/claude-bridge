# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-15

First public version.

### Core
- SQLite note store (`node:sqlite`, no native modules) with FTS5 full-text
  search kept in sync by triggers; namespaces, tags, pagination, note
  revisions (compare-and-swap), provenance, and export/import.
- MCP server over stdio and MCP-over-HTTP (Streamable HTTP), plus a plain REST
  API and a small dashboard. `start` runs the REST API/dashboard **and** the
  MCP-over-HTTP endpoint in one process on a shared store.
- Scoped tokens: `read` / `write` / `admin`, via `ONEMEMORY_TOKENS` (JSON) or
  `data/tokens.json`, enforced identically on the REST API and MCP tools.
- Optional semantic search (keyword / semantic / hybrid) using your own
  OpenAI-compatible or Ollama embeddings endpoint; off by default, with a
  `reindex` CLI command. Degrades to keyword search if the endpoint is down.
- One-command self-host: `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` (non-root user,
  `/ready` health check).
- CLI: `start`, `mcp`, `doctor`, `init`, `reindex`.
- `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (touches the DB) endpoints.
- Docs: install for every MCP client, Cloudflare Access / tunnel setup, and
  "Use with n8n" in `INFRA.md`.

### Security
- Localhost-by-default / fail-closed exposure guard, bearer auth with
  constant-time (SHA-256 + `timingSafeEqual`) compare, DNS-rebinding Origin
  check (loopback + explicit allowlist, does not trust `Origin == Host`),
  per-client rate limiting (`x-forwarded-for` / `cf-connecting-ip` trusted only
  behind an opt-in flag), secret-scan-on-write (title/body/source),
  untrusted-data framing on read, request/response size caps, append-only audit
  log that records operations but never note content.

### Hardened per two rounds of external review
- Compare-and-swap is a single atomic `UPDATE` in a transaction (holds across
  connections/processes, not just in-process).
- Imported notes are embedded for semantic search; import is best-effort
  per-note (a bad note is skipped, not a half-committed batch).
- `/export` is exempt from the response-size cap so a grown store can still be
  backed up; the cap still applies to every other route.
- Oversized request bodies return `413` and malformed JSON `400` consistently
  on both the REST and MCP-over-HTTP front doors (shared body reader).
- MCP tools return a generic error for unexpected faults (no `node:sqlite`
  internals leaked); dashboard output is HTML-escaped under a CSP + `nosniff`.
- `/ready` is behind the rate limiter; rate-limiter memory is hard-bounded.
- Full test suite (154 tests) green on Node 24; 0 production dependency
  vulnerabilities (`npm audit`).
